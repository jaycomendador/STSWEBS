          <p>While mosquito bites account for only a small percentage of the total number of deaths in the world each day, they are nonetheless a significant concern in some African countries. Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the United Republic of Tanzania and Mozambique account for about 53% of all mosquito deaths around the world.</p>

          <h2>Global Statistics</h2>
          <p>Of the 241 million malaria cases that occurred in the country in 2020, 627,000 of them ended in death. A World Health Organization Fact Sheet this disease originates from female Anopheles mosquitos infected by malaria. It is treatable and preventable, however.</p>

 Mosquitoes transmit disease in a variety of ways. In the case of malaria, parasites attach themselves to the gut of a female mosquito and enter a host as she feeds. In other cases, such as yellow fever and dengue, a virus enters the mosquito as it feeds on an infected human and is transmitted via the mosquitoâ€™s saliva to a subsequent victim.
 </p>
 <p class="description">
 Bloodsucking
 Mosquitoes use exhaled carbon dioxide, body odors and temperature, and movement to home in on their victims. Only female mosquitoes have the mouth parts necessary for sucking blood. When biting with their proboscis, they stab two tubes into the skin: one to inject an enzyme that inhibits blood clotting; the other to suck blood into their bodies. They use the blood not for their own nourishment but as a source of protein for their eggs. For food, both males and females eat nectar and other plant sugars.
 </p>
 <p class="description">
 Population Control
 All mosquitoes need water to breed, so eradication and population-control efforts usually involve removal or treatment of standing water sources. Insecticide spraying to kill adult mosquitoes is also widespread. However, global efforts to stop the spread of mosquitoes are having little effect, and many scientists think global warming will likely increase their number and range.
