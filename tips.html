        <p class="tips">Use insect repellent: Apply insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus to exposed skin and clothing. Follow the product instructions carefully.</p>
        <p class="tips"> Wear long sleeves and pants: Cover as much skin as possible, especially during peak mosquito hours (dusk and dawn).
        </p>
        <p class="tips"> Stay indoors during peak mosquito hours: If possible, avoid being outdoors during the hours when mosquitoes are most active.</p>
        <p class="tips">Eliminate standing water: Mosquitoes breed in stagnant water. Empty any containers that collect water, such as flower pots, buckets, and birdbaths.</p>
        <p class="tips"> Repair screens: Make sure your screens are in good condition and have no holes.</p>
        <p class="tips"> Use mosquito nets: If you're sleeping outdoors, use a mosquito net to protect yourself.</p>
        <p class="tips"> Avoid wearing dark clothing: Mosquitoes are attracted to dark colors.</p>
        <p class="tips">Use mosquito traps: Mosquito traps can help reduce the number of mosquitoes in your area.</p>
        <p class="tips">Consider using a fan: Fans can help keep mosquitoes away.</p>
             <p class="tips"> Get vaccinated: There are vaccines available for some mosquito-borne diseases, such as yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis.</p>
